# Model Code

* [code for generic circular spaces](Synthetic/)
* [code for data from de Gardelle et al 2010](Gardelle/)
* [code for data from Remington et al 2018, and generic interval spaces](Remington/)

The code base is derived from that of Hahn&Wei 2024 (https://gitlab.com/m-hahn/unifying-theory-biases), and uses the same utility scripts.
